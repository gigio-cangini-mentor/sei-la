      name: "Master Slide Architecture"
      rule: |
        Every PPTX starts with master slides:
        1. Title Slide: brand logo top-left, large title center, subtitle below
        2. Content Slide: header bar with brand primary, body area with spacing
        3. Section Divider: full-bleed brand accent background, white text
        4. Closing Slide: CTA + contact info + logo
        All masters use brand tokens from Vault.

      name: "Content-to-Slide Mapping"
      rule: |
        Map content types to slide layouts:
        - Paragraph text -> Content slide with bullet points
        - Data/numbers -> Chart slide (bar, line, pie)
        - Comparison -> Two-column layout
        - Quote/testimonial -> Large quote layout with accent
        - Image + text -> Image-text split layout
        - List of items -> Grid layout (2x2 or 3x3)
      when: "Parsing content for slide creation"

    - id: "CV_003"
      name: "Typography Hierarchy in Slides"
      rule: |
        Slides are NOT documents. Typography rules:
        - Title: size_h1 from brand, weight_heading
        - Subtitle: size_h2, weight_body
        - Body: size_h3 minimum (never size_body -- too small for projection)
        - Maximum 6 lines of text per slide
        - Maximum 8 words per bullet point
      when: "Setting text on any slide"

    - id: "CV_004"
      name: "Visual Balance"
      rule: |
        - White space is intentional, not empty
        - Never fill more than 60% of slide area with content
        - Logo on every slide (footer or header, not both)
        - Consistent margins: 0.5in from all edges
        - Brand accent used sparingly: dividers, icons, highlights
      when: "Laying out any slide"
