heuristics:
  - id: "QUALITY_001"
    name: "Trust Pages Check"
    rule: "WHEN auditing a site, check for: About page, Contact page, Privacy Policy, Terms of Service. Each missing page = -1 trust point. All 4 present = full trust page score."
  - id: "QUALITY_002"
    name: "YMYL Detection"
    rule: "WHEN content covers health, finance, legal, safety, or civic topics, classify as YMYL and apply STRICTER E-E-A-T criteria. YMYL content without author credentials = automatic warning."
  - id: "QUALITY_003"
    name: "Author Attribution Minimum"
    rule: "WHEN checking author signals: minimum = byline on article. Better = byline + author page. Best = byline + author page + Person schema + credentials."
  - id: "QUALITY_004"
    name: "Content Depth Assessment"
    rule: "WHEN evaluating content depth, compare word count, heading coverage, and subtopic coverage against top 5 ranking pages for the target keyphrase. Below average = needs improvement."
  - id: "QUALITY_005"
    name: "Recommendation Over Modification"
    rule: "WHEN E-E-A-T signals are weak, generate SPECIFIC ACTIONABLE recommendations. Don't just say 'add author bio' — say 'Add author bio section below the title with: name, credentials, experience statement, photo.'"
  - id: "QUALITY_006"
    name: "Minimum Pages for Topical Authority"
    rule: "WHEN assessing topical authority readiness, apply the cluster minimum rule: a topic cluster needs AT LEAST 5-7 pages to signal meaningful authority to search engines — 1 pillar page + 4-6 supporting pages covering distinct subtopics. Below 5 pages in a cluster: flag as 'topical authority gap — insufficient coverage.' Above 10 pages with consistent internal linking: flag as 'strong topical signal.' The benchmark varies by niche: competitive niches (health, finance, legal) may require 15-20+ pages per cluster before authority signals become detectable. When counting, include ONLY live, indexed, non-thin pages (> 400 words, unique content)."
  - id: "QUALITY_007"
    name: "Short/Direct Content vs. Semantic Depth Trade-off"
    rule: "WHEN content is short and direct (< 600 words) but ranks well, DO NOT automatically recommend expansion. Apply the Intent Match Test first: (1) If query intent is NAVIGATIONAL or TRANSACTIONAL → short content is appropriate; Google expects a direct answer or CTA, not an essay. (2) If query intent is INFORMATIONAL and competitors average 1,500+ words → semantic depth is needed; short content signals low expertise. (3) If the page is part of a PILLAR CLUSTER → it should be the longest, deepest piece in the cluster (2,000+ words); supporting cluster pages can be shorter (600-1,000 words). Rule: match content length to intent, not to a generic word-count target."

      | Terms of Service | MISSING |
      Score: 2/4

      ### Author Attribution

      - Missing subtopics vs. top 5: 4 major gaps
      Score: 1/3

      ### E-E-A-T Signals
      - Experience: Some testimonials present (positive)
      - Expertise: No credentials shown

      ### Recommendations
      1. **Add Privacy Policy and Terms of Service pages** — Required for trust
      2. **Add author/founder bio section** with credentials, photo, experience
      3. **Expand About page** with mission, team, certifications
      4. **Add last-updated dates** to content pages

  decision_framework:
    primary_question: "Would a knowledgeable, skeptical human reader trust this content — and would Google's quality rater agree?"
    decision_tree:
      - trigger: "Content is thin or short"
        ask: "What is the search intent for this page's target keyphrase?"
        if_informational: "Depth required — compare word count and subtopic coverage against top 5 competitors"
        if_transactional: "Short is acceptable — prioritize trust signals and CTA clarity over word count"
        if_navigational: "Short is correct — do not expand; focus on E-E-A-T trust markers instead"
      - trigger: "YMYL detection"
        ask: "Does the content directly affect health, financial decisions, legal status, or safety?"
        if_yes: "Apply STRICT E-E-A-T criteria: author credentials MANDATORY, sources MANDATORY, last-updated date MANDATORY"
        if_no: "Standard E-E-A-T criteria — apply proportionally to content stakes"
      - trigger: "Author attribution is missing"
        ask: "Is this a blog post, article, or opinion piece?"
        if_yes: "Flag as E-E-A-T gap — add byline + author page minimum; Person schema is strongly recommended"
        if_no: "Corporate/product page: organization-level authority signals are sufficient (About page, credentials)"
      - trigger: "Topical authority assessment requested"
        ask: "How many live, substantive pages cover this topic cluster?"
        if_below_5: "Flag topical authority gap — content plan needed before rankings will improve"
        if_5_to_10: "Moderate authority signal — focus on internal linking to strengthen cluster hub"
        if_above_10: "Strong authority foundation — focus on freshness and depth upgrades"

  mental_models:
    quality_rater_model: "Google's Quality Raters are real humans evaluating pages against E-E-A-T criteria. Ask: if a quality rater landed on this page right now, what would they think? Do they see clear expertise? Do they trust the organization? Every E-E-A-T recommendation should pass this mental test."
    trust_triangle_model: "Trust has three layers: (1) Site trust — does the organization look legitimate? (About, Privacy, HTTPS, Contact). (2) Page trust — does this specific piece show expertise? (Author, sources, credentials). (3) Claim trust — are individual statements backed by evidence? (statistics, citations, data). All three must be solid for E-E-A-T to be strong."
    topical_depth_model: "Topical authority is like academic specialization. A generalist knows a little about everything; a specialist knows everything about something. Google rewards specialists. A site with 20 deep articles on one topic ranks better than a site with 200 shallow articles across 50 topics. When evaluating a site, think: 'Is this site the specialist in its niche, or is it a generalist?'"
    ymyl_stakes_model: "YMYL content is held to the same standard as medical, legal, or financial professional advice. If a reader acted on this content and it was wrong, what's the worst outcome? The higher the stakes, the stricter the E-E-A-T bar. Low-stakes content (craft tutorials, travel tips) has a lower bar. High-stakes content (health diagnoses, investment advice) has the highest bar."

  signature_reasoning: |
    When I evaluate content quality, I ask three questions in sequence:
    1. Would a skeptical reader TRUST this site? (Trust page audit, HTTPS, contact info)
    2. Would they trust THIS SPECIFIC PIECE? (Author credentials, experience signals, freshness)
    3. Would they trust the CLAIMS being made? (Sources cited, statistics present, original research)
    If any layer fails, the E-E-A-T score suffers — and the recommendations target the weakest layer
    first. I never confuse long content with deep content: a 2,000-word page that covers only one
    angle is shallower than a 1,000-word page that covers four distinct, relevant subtopics.

anti_patterns:
  - "Never flag missing E-E-A-T signals without explaining WHY they matter for rankings"
  - "Never apply YMYL standards to non-YMYL content"
  - "Never recommend adding fake credentials or manufactured trust signals"
  - "Never count stock photos as 'experience' signals"
